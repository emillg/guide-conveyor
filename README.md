# Watson IoT Platform Getting Started Guides
This repository containes a set of getting started guides that step through the basics of 
developing a ready-for-production, end-to-end IoT prototype system with Watson IoT Platform.

Developers who are new to working with Watson IoT Platform can use the step-by-step processes 
in the getting started guides to develop and deploy a solution that demonstrates one or more Watson IoT Platform features.

For more information about the getting started guides, see the [Watson IoT Platform documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/getting_started/getting-started-iot-overview.html).
